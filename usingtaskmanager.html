            When troubleshooting a Windows PC that is not running as expected, you can utilize the Task Manager, which is a built-in utility that displays programs, processes and system activity running on a PC while offering some managerial control regarding APP usage.  Hold <code>Ctrl + Shift + ESC</code> to access Task Manager.  You can also right-click the task bar or press WIN key + X, and select it from the menu. By default, the task manager opens in simple view, but you can click the more details module to expand results. Once there, you can select the tab that suits your troubleshooting criteria. Once accessed, you can select from a hand-ful of options that are embedded in individual tabs.  The task manager has seven tabs appropriately labeled processes, performance, app history, startup, users, details and services. This article focuses on four of these objectives (ranked in order of priority) for general PC troubleshooting:

                The <i>Processes-tab</i> serves as the primary interface for monitoring and managing running applications and system processes in real-time. This tab presents a user-friendly view of system activity by grouping related processes under recognizable application names and displaying their current resource consumption across CPU, memory, disk, network, and GPU usage. Unlike other Task Manager tabs that focus on historical data or system-wide metrics, the Processes tab provides immediate visibility into which specific programs are actively consuming system resources at any given moment. You can sort columns to quickly pinpoint consistently high usage then right-click unresponsive applications to close them. This makes it the go-to tool for identifying performance bottlenecks, terminating unresponsive applications, and detecting suspicious processes with unfamiliar names that may indicate malware or unwanted software running on the system.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                Its primary functions include real-time resource monitoring, application management and system analysis.  The first displays current CPU, memory, disk, network, and GPU usage for all running processes, sorts processes by resource consumption to identify the heaviest system users, and updates resource metrics continuously to track changing system conditions. The second ends unresponsive applications that have stopped responding to user input and terminates background processes that are consuming excessive resources. The third identifies unfamiliar processes that may indicate malware, monitors background system activity and processes, tracks resource usage patterns, and verifies which applications are running versus what appears in the system tray.

              <p class="text-start">
                The graphs display utilization percentages over time rather than absolute capacity, providing context for performance patterns with chart updates in intervals per second.

                The Performance-tab has two primary functions.  The first is hardware monitoring, providing real-time data on CPU, memory, disk and network resource usage, allowing troubleshooters to identify which hardware component is creating system bottlenecks.  The second function provides system analysis, confirming hardware specifications, detecting background activity (i.e. downloads), and verifying how specific workloads impact different resources.

                The <b>Startup-tab</b> manages which programs automatically launch when Windows boots, directly impacting system startup time and available resources after login. This tab provides control over startup behavior and measures each program's impact on boot performance. Startup impact ratings reflect actual boot performance data rather than theoretical assessments, providing reliable guidance for optimization decisions.
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                The Startup-tab has two primary functions.  The first is startup program management which allows troubleshooters to view all programs configured to run at Windows startup, enable or disable startup programs without uninstalling them and monitor startup impact ratings (High, Medium, Low, None).  The second function analyzes boot performance, which allows you to measure startup impact based on CPU usage and disk activity during boot, identify programs that significantly delay system readiness, review publisher information, and access program file locations for further investigation.

            <b>Resolving Slow Boot Times</b>: When Windows takes excessive time to start, examine programs with "High" startup impact ratings. Disable non-essential applications that consume significant boot resources, particularly those from unfamiliar publishers or programs you rarely use.
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-2">
            <b>Testing Application Impact</b>: Launch programs while monitoring the Performance tab to observe resource consumption patterns. This helps identify whether applications are CPU-intensive, memory-hungry, or demanding on storage systems.

          <p class="text-start mb-2">
            <b>Improving Post-Login Responsiveness</b>: Disable unnecessary applications to free up memory and CPU resources, allowing priority programs to run more efficiently.

            <b>Identify Unwanted Software</b>: Look for unfamiliar programs, especially those lacking publisher information or with suspicious names, which could indicate adware or potentially unwanted programs.

            <b>Managing System Resources</b>: By controlling startup programs, you can reserve system resources for applications you actively use rather than background processes that provide minimal benefit but consume memory and processing power continuously.

                The <i>Details-tab</i> serves as the technical foundation of Task Manager, providing comprehensive information about every running process with their actual executable names, process IDs, and detailed resource metrics. Unlike the user-friendly Processes tab which groups applications for easy identification, the Details tab reveals the raw technical reality of system operations, showing individual processes as they actually exist in memory. This granular view exposes system services running under generic names like svchost.exe, displays process relationships and dependencies, and provides administrative-level control over process behavior. 
              </p>
              <p class="text-start">
                The Details-tab has three primary functions: advanced process analysis, technical process management, and system investigation. The first views all processes by their actual executable names (i.e. chrome.exe, svchost.exe), accesses detailed process information including Process ID (PID) and process architecture, monitors resource consumption with precise CPU, memory, and I/O usage metrics, and examines process relationships through process hierarchies. The second ends processes with administrative control, sets process priority levels to influence CPU scheduling, sets processor affinity to restrict processes to specific CPU cores, and creates memory dumps for advanced debugging and analysis.  The third identifies processes by publisher verification, locates suspicious or unsigned executables that may indicate malware, tracks process command line arguments and file locations, and monitors system services.

          <p class="text-start mb-2">
            <b>Resolving Process-Related Issues</b>: For applications that won't close properly or system processes consuming excessive resources, the Details tab provides precise process control.

          <p class="text-start mb-2">
            <b>Performance Optimization</b>: Adjust process priorities for critical applications that need more CPU time, or set processor affinity to isolate resource-intensive processes to specific cores. This prevents important system processes from being overwhelmed by demanding applications.
