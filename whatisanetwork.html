        <!-- 1. Common Network Types -->
        <article class="mb-4">
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            A network is a group of two or more devices that are linked together to share data and resources. Devices on a network can include computers, tablets, smartphones, printers, IP cameras, and more. This inter-connectivity forms the backbone of modern homes and enterprises, allowing for seamless communication and service integration. IoT (Internet of Things) refers to everyday objects that are connected to a network and can send/receive data. Network standards, such as those defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), ensure devices operate reliably and consistently.
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            There are several common types of networks used to connect devices, each serving different purposes. A LAN (Local Area Network) connects computers and devices within a small area like a home, school, or office. A WAN (Wide Area Network) spans large distances, such as multiple cities or countries, and is often used by businesses with remote locations. A WLAN (Wireless LAN) is a LAN that uses Wi-Fi instead of cables to connect devices. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows secure, encrypted access to a private network over the internet, often used for remote work. Lastly, POLAN (Passive Optical LAN) uses fiber optic cables and no electrical power to transmit data, offering high speed and efficiency in large buildings or campuses.

        <article class="mb-4">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <strong>Enterprise Networks</strong>
          </div>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Enterprise networks are high-performance infrastructures designed to meet the demanding connectivity, security, and scalability requirements of businesses. Unlike home networks, enterprise environments rely on specialized components that provide centralized control, traffic segmentation, and seamless wireless access.
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            One key feature is the use of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), which allow network administrators to logically group devices based on function or department rather than physical location. This segmentation improves performance, enhances security, and simplifies traffic management.
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Wireless connectivity in enterprise settings is typically managed through a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), which centrally administers multiple Wireless Access Points (WAPs). This ensures uniform wireless coverage, secure client authentication, smooth roaming, and effective load balancing. For the WLC to properly manage the WAPs, all components must reside on the same physical LAN, allowing real-time coordination and policy enforcement across the wireless infrastructure.

        <!-- 3. Network Connectivity Flow -->
        <article class="mb-4">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <strong>Network Connectivity Flow</strong>
          </div>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            In a standard wired network, connectivity flows from the end devices such as a computer, phone, or smart appliances to a wall outlet known as a network drop. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mt-2 mb-1 text-muted">Device > Patch Panel > Switch > Router > Modem > ISP</p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Every device has a MAC Address which is unique ID (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) built into the hardware that never changes and helps identify the device on a network. Network drops return to what is called a patch panel, which is used to organize and manage Ethernet cables, typically installed in wiring closets or Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs), allowing devices to be patched into a switch or router. Data travels from the panel to a network switch, which enhances network performance by managing the flow of data, and increases security by controlling access to devices on the network. The switch connects to a router, which serves as the gateway between the local network (LAN) and external networks (WAN), assigning IP addresses and directing outbound traffic. The router in turn connects to a modem, which translates the digital signals into a format understood by the Internet Service Provider (ISP), ultimately enabling access to the broader internet.

        <!-- 4. Protocols & IP Addressing -->
        <article class="mb-4">
          <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center">
            <strong>Protocols & IP Addressing</strong>
          </div>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Network communication relies on protocols: structured rules that allow computers and devices to understand each other. When devices are connected using cables (like Ethernet), they follow a specific protocol to organize and send data efficiently across the network. At the core of all internet activity is the TCP/IP suite: Transmission Control Protocol ensures data is sent and received accurately, while Internet Protocol assigns a unique address to every device so information can reach the correct destination.
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            These unique identifiers are called IP addresses, which act like digital street addresses or phone numbers for devices. Most networks today use IPv4 addresses (e.g., <code>192.168.1.101</code>), though a newer format called IPv6 (e.g., <code>2001:0db8::1</code>) provides more room for the growing number of internet-connected devices. Devices are assigned IP addresses automatically through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol), which also provides other network settings like the subnet mask and gateway. To help users access websites more easily, the DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names (e.g., <code>www.google.com</code>) into IP addresses. On the other hand, NAT (Network Address Translation) enables multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet, an essential function for homes and businesses.

            <strong>Network Cabling & Transmission Media</strong>
          </div> 
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Modern networks rely on high-performance cabling to move data between devices quickly and reliably. Ethernet cables come in various categories and support different speeds depending on the quality of materials, frequency rating, and design. These cables follow the Base-T naming convention standard, which defines performance based on speed: 10 Mbps (10Base), 100 Mbps (100Base), 1 Gbps (1000Base), and 10 Gbps (10GBase).
          </p>
          <p class="text-start mb-1">
            Cables are categorized by type—such as CAT 5e, CAT 6, and CAT 6e—each supporting higher frequencies and faster speeds. While CAT 5e supports up to 1 Gbps, CAT 6 and 6e can handle up to 10 Gbps and beyond, depending on conditions. Shielded versions (STP) help reduce electromagnetic interference, especially in dense or noisy environments, though unshielded (UTP) remains common in typical installations. Performance also depends on proper cable length and installation quality.
